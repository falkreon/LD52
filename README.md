This is my entry for Ludum Dare 52. You start out battling monstrous plants, but when you collect seeds from them, you can switch to a gardening screen. Poisons and herbs you get from your garden can then buy more battle upgrades. Passive upgrades quickly overwhelm the enemies and it's possible to buy up every upgrade in one long sitting.


To run it straight from the repo, go into src/ and open index.html in your favorite browser. There is no facility for packing it as an electron app or anything, it's just raw html5.


Only bugfixes and ports are permitted in this branch, this is the compo branch.
