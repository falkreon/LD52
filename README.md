# LD52 - Harvest

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 52. The intent is to start out as a battler, but when seeds drop, unfold into a windowsill gardening game as well. Poisons and herbs you get from your garden can then buy more battle upgrades and hopefully we'll wind up with a nice ebb and flow between the two tabs.
